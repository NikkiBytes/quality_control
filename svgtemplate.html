<docinit>
    Here we register the fonts and colors to be used throughout
    the document.
</docinit>

<template>
    Here we define templates for the document.
    They can include frames to handle flowing text, as well as
    static components of the page, such as images, text, and
    graphics. Later on, as we pass in our content, we can choose
    which templates to use for each page.
</template>

<stylesheet>
    Here we define paragraph and table styles much like you
    would in a word processor.
</stylesheet>

<story>
    Now it gets interesting. You've put in all the hard effort of
    defining styles, frames, and fonts, and now it's time to give
    your document some content.
